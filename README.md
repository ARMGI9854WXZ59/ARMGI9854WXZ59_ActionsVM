Connect to GitHub Actions via SSH, get macOS or Linux VM for free.

## Usage

- Click the [Use this template](https://github.com/rdp-studio/ActionsVM/generate) button to create a new repository.
- Select `macOS (tmate)` or `Ubuntu (tmate)` on the Actions page.
- Click the `Run workflow` button.
- Get the connection info in the log.

## TIPS

- Note that your repo needs to be public, otherwise you have a strict monthly limit on how many minutes you can use.
- Your session can run for up to six hours. Don't forget to close it after finishing your work, otherwise you will continue to occupy this virtual machine, making it impossible for others to use it normally.
- Please check the [GitHub Actions Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-additional-product-terms#5-actions-and-packages). According to the TOS the repo that contains these files needs to be the same one where you're developing the project that you're using it for, and specifically that you are using it for the "*production, testing, deployment, or publication of [that] software project*".
